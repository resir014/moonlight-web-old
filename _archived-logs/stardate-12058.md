[19:39] <+Keon> knot
[19:39] <+Wirt> Playing Super Mario RPG
[19:39] <+Keon> my brother and i made a penis themed level in SSB4
[19:39] <+Keon> and i asked him if i could make a weiner
[19:39] <+Keon> and he said okay
[19:39] <+Keon> and i made a canine dick
[19:39] <+Keon> and then he said
[19:40] <+Keon> NO DOG DICKS IN THIS HOUSE
[19:40] <+Wirt> A+ bonding right there
[19:40] <+Metawolf_> Eww
[19:40] <+Keon> and he said why does it have 2 sets of balls

[19:41] <+Metawolf_> Extra balls ftw
[19:41] <+Keon> 'Balls"
[19:41] <+Keon> you can KNOT be joking
[19:42] <+Metawolf_> Yes i am jöking
[19:42] <+Metawolf_> Jõking
[19:43] <+Keon> yolking
[19:43] <+Metawolf_> I really need to google how a knot exactly works
[19:43] <+Wirt> folking around
[19:43] Quit: Saturn [Quit: quit]
[19:43] <+Keon> midnight are you an expert on dog dicks or are you KNOT
[19:44] <+Midnight> well u see
[19:44] <+Metawolf_> Saturn couldn't handle the knot
[19:44] <+Midnight> it swells after the penetration
[19:44] <+Yrr> c==O3
[19:44] <+Keon> he could KNOT handle it
[19:45] <+Midnight> so once they start they gotta finish
[19:45] <+Midnight> evolution
[19:45] <+Keon> why didnt WE get the knot
[19:45] <+Keon> could we knot handle it
[19:45] <+Metawolf_> So it's just extra swelling and nothing more?
[19:45] <+Midnight> mhm
[19:45] <+Midnight> we dont have one because i guess our sex drive was enough as is lmao
[19:45] <@STARLIGHT> [NOW PLAYING: deadmau5 - Limit Break] | [Listeners: 2]
[19:46] <+Midnight> its swelling at a specific point ofc
[19:46] <+Metawolf_> True, true
[19:46] <+Keon> evolution was like no raping
[19:46] <+Keon> but we did it anyway
[19:46] <+Metawolf_> Ok well i thought there was more to it, Midnight
[19:46] <+Metawolf_> But it's actually quite simple
[19:46] <+Midnight> on the contrary
[19:46] <+Midnight> it isnt nerve stimulation that triggers it
[19:46] <+Midnight> so scientists were looking at every possible cause from a hormone exchange to a specific neurotransmitter
[19:47] <+Keon> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBeeZ_rGOnM
[19:47] <+Midnight> or maybe a combination of everything
[19:47] <+Midnight> so maybe it is complicated
[19:48] <+Midnight> oh boy ive heard this before
[19:48] <+Keon> of course you have
[19:48] Quit: undefined [Ping timeout: 180 seconds]
[19:48] <+Metawolf_> Knots are fascinating

[19:52] <+Metawolf_> Shall we step it up a knotch?
[19:52] <+ATLAS_Moon> I'm currious to see how far this can go
[19:52] <+Metawolf_> Not farther than the knot
[19:52] <+Midnight> maybe if we try really hard
[19:52] <+ATLAS_Moon> I dare you too
[19:53] <+Metawolf_> "Hard" lolz
