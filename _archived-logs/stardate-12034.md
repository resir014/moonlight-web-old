//BEGIN LOGS//
<ghostshadows> log: the ship seems empty, I cant seem to find anyone, but the ship says 11 people on board, I only see myself
<ghostshadows> log: I found Yrr, but we're still short 9 people :/
<ghostshadows> log: update: found ATLAS_Moon
<ghostshadows> log: being on this ship just is not as fun as it used to be, but I make up for it by drifting off in thought while watching the stars.
<ghostshadows> log: these are dark times, on starlight, everyone joins, then leaves soon after...
<Penumbra> log: while I was away more astronauts have joined our voyage
<Kitanai> log: i invited them
<Kitanai> log: also, is wolfgun still asleep? don't tell him about the soda last night
<ghostshadows> log: we hid wolfgun's sleeping body in the hidden closet, near the back of the ship, I cleaned it thankfully
<Kitanai> log: does he still have sticky notes all over him
<ghostshadows> log: Wolfgun is a *very* heavy sleeper
<Kitanai> log: HEY LETS INVITE MORE PEOPLE INTO THE SHIP
<ghostshadows> log: Kitanai thinks its ok to have more people join, its already a bit crowded again
<Kitanai> log: im taking over this ship
<Kitanai> log: we're going to the meme sector
<ghostshadows> log: but noone here knows how to fly the ship
<cross> log: wolfgun said no more memes or bees, but i left some in the refrigerator
<Kitanai> log: i think i just found a new area out in space. we seem to be heading to what appears to be a lot of papers with drawings floating around ...
<ghostshadows> log: no matter what i use, people still find ways to try to cook food on the ion drives
<Kitanai> log: oh god, they all seem to be anime men with giant hands
<Kitanai> log: i think we just entered the yaoi zone
<ghostshadows> log: where's the twilight zone again?
<Kitanai> log: AVERT THE YOUNGIN'S EYES, WE ARE IN THE YAOI ZONE
<ghostshadows> log: after using google now, i managed to steer away from the yaoi zone
<ghostshadows> log: celluar reception sucks in space
<Kitanai> log: thanks to ghost, we are now out of that hell
<cross> log: they've stopped communicating normally, and are only logging things
<ghostshadows> log: i dont think cross gets this logging thing
<cross> log: they're onto me
<ghostshadows> log: cross seems to get what we're trying to accomplish by handing out logbooks to the new members here
<Kitanai> log: he's probably mentally stressed like the rest of us
ghostshadows> log: Its great having people back on the ship again, the 20-ish hours of almost complete alone :c
<Kitanai> log: i see ghost has redirected us out of the yaoi zone, but i feel we are about to crash into planet facebook, and the notification meteors are surrounding the ship
<ghostshadows> log: this starlight guy just sits here, saying what is playing on the radio, it can get really annoying, as it butts into our conversations, when there is one...
<Kitanai> log: someone get us out, i don't know what's worse - yaoi or a facebook that is rarely used with a shit ton of notifications around it
<ghostshadows> log: I scanned the surface of Planet Facebook, and I saw things, people not getting vaccines because of autism or something, its bullshit
<ghostshadows> log: i turned the ship around, to what is hopefully not another planet
<Kitanai> log: i see there's a shit ton of fights going out here
<ghostshadows> log: I scanned ahead, and the place we're heading to, is the Saturday Night Live Zone.
<Kitanai> log: oh good. we're out of that old place. i saw the continents of the planet spelled out "2012" so i wonder if it's about to go out like myspace did in a few years.
<ghostshadows> log: Saturn just exploded
<ghostshadows> log: that sucks
<Kitanai> log: WHAT THE FUCK GHOST HE BETTER RESPAWN SOON
<Kitanai> log: well at least he's currently in a better place now
<ghostshadows> log: After explaining to Kitanai that when we explode, we usually come back after a few hours.
<ghostshadows> log: The food replicator is now fully functional, so we can now have whatever food we want :D
<Penumbra> log: but i liked grits
<Kitanai> log: fuck grits
<ghostshadows> log: I had to show Penumbra that the replicator can still make grits
<Kitanai> log:  see we're in the saturday night live zone now. a giant chris pratt floats around in an attempt to sing but nothing comes out  because he's in space
<ghostshadows> log: Hey, Hans and Frans are floating around
<ghostshadows> log: OH SHIT A GIANT 40 IS ABOUT TO HIT THE SHIP
<ghostshadows> log: crisis avoided, we've made it through the SNL zone.
<Kitanai> log: i tried to grab whatever steers this damn ship and got us out of the way luckily.
<Kitanai> log:  but i think now we're going into the Home of Challenge Pissing.
<ghostshadows> log: cross exploded, then reappeared short after
<cross> log: not the first time for that
<Kitanai> log: OH GOD THE SHIP IS SUDDENLY IN AN OCEAN OF PISS
<ghostshadows> log: wait, are he heading to the Challenge Cluster? I think I can see brown shugar
<Kitanai> log: I DON'T THINK THAT BROWN STUFF IS SUGAR-
<ghostshadows> log: Kitanai is succumbing to illusions, the sensors say its brown sugar
<ghostshadows> log: Kitanai's sane self will be missed
<Kitanai> log: I WILL ADVISE EVERYONE AS WE GET THROUGH THE HOME OF CHALLENGE PISSING, DO NOT TRY TO EAT THE BROWN SUGAR
<ghostshadows> log: I think I heard some noises from the closet that Wolfgun is in
<ghostshadows> log: they stopped
<cross> log: vporized LSD in circulation system appears to be a success. Kitanai and ghostshadows completely delusional
<ghostshadows> log: The stars are flowers...
<ghostshadows> log: I need to fix this
<cross> log: running in the 90s
<ghostshadows> log: I'll try to sleep this off...
* ghostshadows sleeps on the beds, making sure it was *not* Penumbra this time
<Kitanai> log: cross seems to be correct. we're going into The 90's. A timepause in space. We see old Windows computers and abstract art, as well as badly edited music videos.
<cross> log: the ship's material is now entirely composed of beige plastic
<Kitanai> log: Also, a lot of childhood shows are appearing on old TV sets. There's VCR's floating around of Disney movies.
<Kitanai> log: I hear the Space Jam theme echoing. Sound must be bouncing off all of these old, nostalgic and forgotten objects.
<ghostshadows> log: I've awoken, and this time, with no immediate pain
<Kitanai> log: I think The 90's is connected to the Vaporwave Channel. We might be going through there, but I could be wrong.
<ghostshadows> log: To update my condition; the stars are *not* flowers anymore
<Kitanai> log: instead it's all old bowling ball galaxy and space carpets
<ghostshadows> log: Well, everything is beige now, and there's a ton of cool shit flying around outside, might as well keep a few souviners
<Kitanai> log: i look at ghost and whisper "im on it". i suddenly open one of the ship doors and prepare to jump out
<ghostshadows> log: so, Kitanai just went out of the ship, I tethered them to the ship, so hopefully they come back with lots of goodies :3
<Kitanai> log: i came back with a shit ton of towers and monitors running Windows 95 and some vintage video games and consoles. i grabbed all the Jurassic Park things i could find. theres a big pile slowly  drug into the ship and we dig around through it together.
<ghostshadows> log: I have cleaned out a supply closet with cleaning shit, and put all our finds there
* Kitanai gently opens the door and peeps to check on him
<Kitanai> log: i think wolfgun  is dying i think we should check on him
* ghostshadows throws grits all over Wolfgun
<ghostshadows> log: Wolfgun's body just, absorbed all the grits that were thrown on him
<Kitanai> log: we went to check on wolfgun to see how he was doing. he's still knocked out but i'm concerned for his health. ghostshadow just threw grits all over him
<Kitanai> log: i look over to shyelfie23
<cross> log: 20XX
<Kitanai> log: they seem to really like their phone
<Kimmi> log: holy shit, what am i doing up in the stars
<Saturn> hi i woke up at 3am now im sleepy again bye
<undefined> log: i just teleported here
<Kimmi> log: goodnight, saturn baby
<Kitanai> log: saturn keeps exploding i wonder if there's a glitch going on
<Kitanai> log: i think we should clean those grits off wolfgun now
<Kimmi> log: Professor Oak, you're no Birch
<Kitanai> log: i just decided to give him a quick bath with some baby wipes. he snorted once when i got too close to his snout but i think hes fine, i dont think he snorted any grits. at least i know he is alive now
<Kimmi> log: im raving im raving
<Kitanai> log: OH GOD HE STARTED COUGHING DO I DO CPR
<Kimmi> log: *melbourne shuffle*
<Kitanai> log: I JUST DID MOUTH TO MOUTH WITH A WOLF BUT THE GRITS ARE OUT, HE IS SAFE
<Kitanai> log: i went to brush my teeth and i found the toothpaste was replaced with food. who replaced the toothpaste with food you know astronauts dont have to do that  anymore
<Kimmi> log: I brought dried food balls.
<undefined> log: after teleporting back into the ship, i read everyone's logs
<Kitanai> log: deer , aka HellieCharty comes into the room sweating
<undefined> log: i've been back for 15 minutes and no-one noticed until now. i'm very sneaky
<Kitanai> log: i noticed
<Kimmi> log: I really wanna hang out with Trevor and Izzy, but I'm too busy with my new space friends...
<Kitanai> log: deer looks right at me and prepares to speak
<Nugflow> enim si ytoob ruoy ,reed :gol
<Kitanai> log: all he said was "hey"
<Kitanai> log: his sweat says enough
<Kimmi_Kitty> log: i walk to the bathroom and go on my communicator.
<Kitanai> log: popcorn is better than grits. also we're now having a fight on who's going to win Deer 's butt.
