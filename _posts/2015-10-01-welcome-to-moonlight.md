Hello, and welcome to MOONLIGHT, home to the best music, the dankest memes, and the angriest sergals.

We're a bunch of music enthusiasts who used to fondle around in the [STARLIGHT](http://starlight.roadtojupiter.com) IRC and radio stream, before its unexpected closure. Continuing on the spirit of STARLIGHT, we've set up our own radio stream for everyone to enjoy.

## Home of the best music.

At MOONLIGHT, we strive to be the the home of the best music for everyone. Our team of music gatherers has come forth and provided us with the dankest playlist you can imagine. We already know you'll love it.

Here's what you'll expect when listening to Moonlight Radio:

* Wolfgun
* Even more Wolfgun
* There's Never Enough Wolfgun
* MACINTOSH PLUS - リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー
* And everything else.

In fact, we're not sure what else is in our playlist, so I guess we'll just play Wolfgun[^fn-wg].

Yeah. That's pretty much it.

## Featuring the most advanced streaming technology. Ever.

</figure>

Our servers run the amazing, critically-acclaimed Windows Server 2003 operating system, because it won't be 悪寒ダイビング unless it's 美学 as fuck.

On top of that, we occasionally stream with Winamp, because Winamp is love, and Winamp is life. Though we also use software like foobar2000, on some occasions. Either way, everything is streamed through SHOUTcast to ensure guaranteed 24/7 uptime[^fn-uptime].

## And of course, sergals.

Sergals. Sergals are cool.

## We hope you'll enjoy it.

This server is made out of the labour of love of the STARLIGHT crew, most notably [@faintshadows](https://twitter.com/faintshadows), [@hexdefined](https://twitter.com/hexdefined), and [@resir014](https://twitter.com/resir014).

[^fn-wg]: You should really check out Wolfgun, though. They're pretty cool. <http://wolfgun.bandcamp.com>
[^fn-uptime]: Not actually guaranteed.
