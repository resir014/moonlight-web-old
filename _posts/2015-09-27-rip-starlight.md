In case you've been living under a rock lately, STARLIGHT Radio has finally been shut down.

It was one hell of an experience hanging out in the STARLIGHT stream and IRC. All the laughs, tears, new friendships, you name it. To those who have been with us all the way, shoutout to all of you. If it weren't for you guys, we'd never get to this point in our lives.

This website will not go anywhere though. We're currently hard at work to revamp this website, so watch this space for more interesting things to come.

So long and thanks for all the fish.
