<ghostshadows> log: i somehow managed to live past wolfgun's murderous spree, my ghost abilities are showing
<HellieCharty> log: distress signal noted on the starmap, seems RT jettisoned from the ship to get away from the crew again
<undefined> log: i am undefined, so by definition i don't exist, so i can't be killed
<ghostshadows> log: we found RT on radar, but wolfgun refuses to change course, since it would put us near skrilfeld
<ghostshadows> log: after searching for a few days, i think i found a way to fix the replicator so we can finally get off this grits-only diet
<ghostshadows> log: i've ordered the parts to fix the replicator, Space Amazon should have it delivered in about... 15 minutes?
<undefined> log: it seems that people are getting tired of logging
<Penumbra> log: where did HellieCharty go?
<ghostshadows> log: everything kinda stopped, everyone died down, we can actually calm down, and watch the stars fly by

<meme_machine> log: no. no they aren't
<Kitanai> log: update - meme_machine eventually cringes in regret of his username
<nugflow> log: 2012 came back for revenge. all the steel beams in the ship have been melted down. we're gonna die soon
<Kitanai> log: i shield myself from the freshman and their meme-themed joking ways by climbing up the stairs to upper levels of classmanship. i'm slowly coming near the door out of this hell
<nugflow> log: are you serious? no i'm a skeleton
<ghostshadows> log: I've successfully smuggled my Smuckers Uncrustables on the ship, nobody has noticed them yet. wait, are these logs public?!
<meme_machine> log: can you cook a pbj sandwich on ion drives? let's find out
<meme_machine> log: NO YOU CANNOT ABORT
<ghostshadows> log: someone tried cooking a PBJ on the ion drives, why do we even try anymore
<Conor> log: you bring light in
<Skul> Log: I have been breaking out into hives.  I beleve someone has smuggled peanutbutter onboard
<Kitanai> log: i just got my pop tarts. and grape soda, but realized i had another soda, and i am glad that i did not open it.
<Kitanai> log: wait now that i realize wouldn't this soda be going everywhere without gravity now
<Kitanai> log: OH GOD IT'S ON MY SHIRT HE-
<ghostshadows> log: after fixing the artificial gravity, i realized that i made a mistake, Kitanai has soda all over them.
<Skul> log: why are these buttons sticky?
<meme_machine> log: ;)
<ghostshadows> log: after cleaning the 'unknown substance' off the control panel, i realized that the windows are all fogged up again, the prints are back :c
<Everclef> log: when  i got on this ship it wasn't  moving. are we in space are those space rods flying past us
<Kitanai> log: *loudly burps*
<ghostshadows> log: Hoping Yrr will come back soon with an updated map with our current location, as we're in the dark without Wolfgun 
<ghostshadows> log: Conor is back, but we don't know if he can fly the ship, and wolfgun is covered in sticky notes, sleeping, so lets hope we dont hit anything
<Kitanai> log: uh guys i think there's soda all over wolfgun's pants how are we gonna explain that to him when he wakes up
<Skul> log: we seem to have received a distress call from what appears to be a green dorito
<Everclef> log: i learned today that it's really hard to draw penises on fur
<ghostshadows> log: The docking thrusters are FUBAR, so I've gotta order some off SpaceAmazon
<meme_machine> log: does ANYTHING work on this damn ships besides the ion drives
<Kitanai> log: everclef ya gotta use a sheath or have fur overlap the base a bit
<meme_machine> log: and the ion drives are really just stoves at this pont
<Kitanai> log: why are we talking about this lets not talk about this
<ghostshadows> log: I recieved the parts to fix the replicator, so we can get off the grits only diet
<Kitanai> log: but im already eating pop tarts
<ghostshadows> log: The smell of freshly replicated non-grits food is an amazing smell
<meme_machine> log: can we replicate more grits
<Kitanai> log: so are these pop tarts
<meme_machine> log: i like grits
<log> this was not a good idea
<Everclef> log: where did conor go
<Everclef> log: i guess we run the ship now
<ghostshadows> log: I've found more food on the ion drives, and some... fecal matter.
<Everclef> log: where are all of our steel beams
<Everclef> log: how is this ship still moving
<Skul> log: is no one going to address the fact we received a distress call from a humanoid rock?
<ghostshadows> log: wait, where'd conor go, oh there he is, he's having an identity crisis
<ghostshadows> log: I explained to Everclef that until i get people to stop cooking on the ion drives, we're actually drifting at high speeds, our course being changed by nearby stars gravities
<Kitanai> log: guys, HellieCharty has an insane puppy on the ship aboard ow and its really hyper. dont let it grab any of my sodas o
<Everclef> log: that's nice and all but where did all of our steel beams go
<Kitanai> log: or shits gonna get broke*
<ghostshadows> log: i put chicken wire around the ion drives, but there's a pizza stuck in the wire :/
<Kitanai> log: hellie will devour it
<Everclef> log: it's a miracle the ship hasn't been torn in half because we have no steel beams anywhere
<HellieCharty> log: actually brb I need to shower since I have work tomorrow
<Kitanai> log: hellie has work getting these beams back
<ghostshadows> log: I have found a secret room in the ship, and ordered steel beams to be delivered
<Everclef> log: when kitanai goes to sleep, let's follow his advice
<ghostshadows> log: this secret room is filled with @_Ninji's shitposts written all over the walls
<ghostshadows> log: the artificial gravity went out again, wolfgun's sleeping body is just floating, we dont want to wake him
* krantu puls out a sharpie
<ghostshadows> log: I found out what the red light ment, theres a distress call, but we cant help, wolfgun's asleep.
<ghostshadows> log: Fixed the ion drives, all working now, but we still dont know the destination of the ship
<ghostshadows> log: someone is messing with the radio, STARLIGHT radio has been replaced with reruns of Seinfeld
<ghostshadows> log: wait, the ship is turning... are we headed back to skrillfeld?!?!?
<ghostshadows> log: I've got to fix the radio, to see if we're heading towards skrillfeld
<ghostshadows> log: some random guy is spitting out binary code, we dont know what he's saying yet.
<Everclef> log: space is scary i wanna go back to EBONY
ghostshadows> log: It seems that it was just Penumbra messing with us
<ghostshadows> log: someone named batman joined, I dont trust him...
<ghostshadows> log: I've got to check the food replicator, see if my repairs worked
<ghostshadows> log: either Everclef is lying, or the storage closet was actually not a bathroom

/**<Skul> Actualy it says Bat Room
<ghostshadows> oh really
<ghostshadows> shit **\

<ghostshadows> log: We've seemed to mistake the Bat Room for a bathroom
<ghostshadows> log: All the repairs today, I've got to take a quick nap, the beds here aren't the best, but they're ok
<Everclef> log: someone shouted something racist then locked themselves in the poop closet. i'm going to get in  the airlock now
<Everclef> log: i'm opening the airlock
<ghostshadows> log: I've waken up, with a sharp pain in my backside, what happened?!?!
<ghostshadows> log: wait did the airlocks just open?
<Everclef> log: this space vacuum i just exposed the ship to doesn't exist, it's just an illusion
<Penumbra> we're in one of those quarter rides outsde of safeway

/** <Skul> Then where did my burrito go?
<Penumbra> i put it in ghostsahdows butt
<Penumbra> ghostshadows *\\

<ghostshadows> log: things happened in the improvised bathroom, bad things...
<Everclef> log: guys under the "fuel" marker there's just nothing
<Everclef> log: i think we spent all of our fuel making logs
<ghostshadows> log: I put a sign to not go into the improvised bathroom
<ghostshadows> log: The fuel went out, i guess we're slowing down...
<ghostshadows> log: we seem to be decreasing speed at 12 meters a second per half hour
<Everclef> at least when we die, and people discover the remains of our ship, they can look at us and say "at least they had a separate room to poop in"
<ghostshadows> log: I've started research on alternative fuel for the ion drives, and i think we can!

//DATE + TIME//
STARDATE 12034

//BEGIN LOGS//
<ghostshadows> log: the ship seems empty, I cant seem to find anyone, but the ship says 11 people on board, I only see myself
<ghostshadows> log: I found Yrr, but we're still short 9 people :/
<ghostshadows> log: update: found ATLAS_Moon 
<ghostshadows> log: being on this ship just is not as fun as it used to be, but I make up for it by drifting off in thought while watching the stars.
<ghostshadows> log: these are dark times, on starlight, everyone joins, then leaves soon after...
<Penumbra> log: while I was away more astronauts have joined our voyage
<Kitanai> log: i invited them
<Kitanai> log: also, is wolfgun still asleep? don't tell him about the soda last night
<ghostshadows> log: we hid wolfgun's sleeping body in the hidden closet, near the back of the ship, I cleaned it thankfully
<Kitanai> log: does he still have sticky notes all over him
<ghostshadows> log: Wolfgun is a *very* heavy sleeper
<Kitanai> log: HEY LETS INVITE MORE PEOPLE INTO THE SHIP
<ghostshadows> log: Kitanai thinks its ok to have more people join, its already a bit crowded again
<Kitanai> log: im taking over this ship
<Kitanai> log: we're going to the meme sector
<ghostshadows> log: but noone here knows how to fly the ship
<cross> log: wolfgun said no more memes or bees, but i left some in the refrigerator
<Kitanai> log: i think i just found a new area out in space. we seem to be heading to what appears to be a lot of papers with drawings floating around ...
<ghostshadows> log: no matter what i use, people still find ways to try to cook food on the ion drives
<Kitanai> log: oh god, they all seem to be anime men with giant hands
<Kitanai> log: i think we just entered the yaoi zone
<ghostshadows> log: where's the twilight zone again?
<Kitanai> log: AVERT THE YOUNGIN'S EYES, WE ARE IN THE YAOI ZONE
<ghostshadows> log: after using google now, i managed to steer away from the yaoi zone
<ghostshadows> log: celluar reception sucks in space
<Kitanai> log: thanks to ghost, we are now out of that hell
<cross> log: they've stopped communicating normally, and are only logging things
<ghostshadows> log: i dont think cross gets this logging thing
<cross> log: they're onto me
<ghostshadows> log: cross seems to get what we're trying to accomplish by handing out logbooks to the new members here
<Kitanai> log: he's probably mentally stressed like the rest of us
ghostshadows> log: Its great having people back on the ship again, the 20-ish hours of almost complete alone :c
<Kitanai> log: i see ghost has redirected us out of the yaoi zone, but i feel we are about to crash into planet facebook, and the notification meteors are surrounding the ship
<ghostshadows> log: this starlight guy just sits here, saying what is playing on the radio, it can get really annoying, as it butts into our conversations, when there is one...
<Kitanai> log: someone get us out, i don't know what's worse - yaoi or a facebook that is rarely used with a shit ton of notifications around it
<ghostshadows> log: I scanned the surface of Planet Facebook, and I saw things, people not getting vaccines because of autism or something, its bullshit
<ghostshadows> log: i turned the ship around, to what is hopefully not another planet
<Kitanai> log: i see there's a shit ton of fights going out here
<ghostshadows> log: I scanned ahead, and the place we're heading to, is the Saturday Night Live Zone.
<Kitanai> log: oh good. we're out of that old place. i saw the continents of the planet spelled out "2012" so i wonder if it's about to go out like myspace did in a few years.
<ghostshadows> log: Saturn just exploded
<ghostshadows> log: that sucks
<Kitanai> log: WHAT THE FUCK GHOST HE BETTER RESPAWN SOON
<Kitanai> log: well at least he's currently in a better place now
<ghostshadows> log: After explaining to Kitanai that when we explode, we usually come back after a few hours.
<ghostshadows> log: The food replicator is now fully functional, so we can now have whatever food we want :D
<Penumbra> log: but i liked grits
<Kitanai> log: fuck grits
<ghostshadows> log: I had to show Penumbra that the replicator can still make grits
<Kitanai> log:  see we're in the saturday night live zone now. a giant chris pratt floats around in an attempt to sing but nothing comes out  because he's in space
<ghostshadows> log: Hey, Hans and Frans are floating around
<ghostshadows> log: OH SHIT A GIANT 40 IS ABOUT TO HIT THE SHIP
<ghostshadows> log: crisis avoided, we've made it through the SNL zone.
<Kitanai> log: i tried to grab whatever steers this damn ship and got us out of the way luckily.
<Kitanai> log:  but i think now we're going into the Home of Challenge Pissing.
<ghostshadows> log: cross exploded, then reappeared short after
<cross> log: not the first time for that
<Kitanai> log: OH GOD THE SHIP IS SUDDENLY IN AN OCEAN OF PISS
<ghostshadows> log: wait, are he heading to the Challenge Cluster? I think I can see brown shugar
<Kitanai> log: I DON'T THINK THAT BROWN STUFF IS SUGAR-
<ghostshadows> log: Kitanai is succumbing to illusions, the sensors say its brown sugar
<ghostshadows> log: Kitanai's sane self will be missed
<Kitanai> log: I WILL ADVISE EVERYONE AS WE GET THROUGH THE HOME OF CHALLENGE PISSING, DO NOT TRY TO EAT THE BROWN SUGAR
<ghostshadows> log: I think I heard some noises from the closet that Wolfgun is in
<ghostshadows> log: they stopped
<cross> log: vporized LSD in circulation system appears to be a success. Kitanai and ghostshadows completely delusional
<ghostshadows> log: The stars are flowers...
<ghostshadows> log: I need to fix this
<cross> log: running in the 90s
<ghostshadows> log: I'll try to sleep this off...
* ghostshadows sleeps on the beds, making sure it was *not* Penumbra this time
<Kitanai> log: cross seems to be correct. we're going into The 90's. A timepause in space. We see old Windows computers and abstract art, as well as badly edited music videos.
<cross> log: the ship's material is now entirely composed of beige plastic
<Kitanai> log: Also, a lot of childhood shows are appearing on old TV sets. There's VCR's floating around of Disney movies.
<Kitanai> log: I hear the Space Jam theme echoing. Sound must be bouncing off all of these old, nostalgic and forgotten objects.
<ghostshadows> log: I've awoken, and this time, with no immediate pain
<Kitanai> log: I think The 90's is connected to the Vaporwave Channel. We might be going through there, but I could be wrong.
<ghostshadows> log: To update my condition; the stars are *not* flowers anymore
<Kitanai> log: instead it's all old bowling ball galaxy and space carpets
<ghostshadows> log: Well, everything is beige now, and there's a ton of cool shit flying around outside, might as well keep a few souviners
<Kitanai> log: i look at ghost and whisper "im on it". i suddenly open one of the ship doors and prepare to jump out
<ghostshadows> log: so, Kitanai just went out of the ship, I tethered them to the ship, so hopefully they come back with lots of goodies :3
<Kitanai> log: i came back with a shit ton of towers and monitors running Windows 95 and some vintage video games and consoles. i grabbed all the Jurassic Park things i could find. theres a big pile slowly  drug into the ship and we dig around through it together.
<ghostshadows> log: I have cleaned out a supply closet with cleaning shit, and put all our finds there
* Kitanai gently opens the door and peeps to check on him
<Kitanai> log: i think wolfgun  is dying i think we should check on him
* ghostshadows throws grits all over Wolfgun
<ghostshadows> log: Wolfgun's body just, absorbed all the grits that were thrown on him
<Kitanai> log: we went to check on wolfgun to see how he was doing. he's still knocked out but i'm concerned for his health. ghostshadow just threw grits all over him
<Kitanai> log: i look over to shyelfie23
<cross> log: 20XX
<Kitanai> log: they seem to really like their phone
<Kimmi> log: holy shit, what am i doing up in the stars
<Saturn> hi i woke up at 3am now im sleepy again bye
<undefined> log: i just teleported here
<Kimmi> log: goodnight, saturn baby
<Kitanai> log: saturn keeps exploding i wonder if there's a glitch going on
<Kitanai> log: i think we should clean those grits off wolfgun now
<Kimmi> log: Professor Oak, you're no Birch
<Kitanai> log: i just decided to give him a quick bath with some baby wipes. he snorted once when i got too close to his snout but i think hes fine, i dont think he snorted any grits. at least i know he is alive now
<Kimmi> log: im raving im raving
<Kitanai> log: OH GOD HE STARTED COUGHING DO I DO CPR
<Kimmi> log: *melbourne shuffle*
<Kitanai> log: I JUST DID MOUTH TO MOUTH WITH A WOLF BUT THE GRITS ARE OUT, HE IS SAFE
<Kitanai> log: i went to brush my teeth and i found the toothpaste was replaced with food. who replaced the toothpaste with food you know astronauts dont have to do that  anymore
<Kimmi> log: I brought dried food balls.
<undefined> log: after teleporting back into the ship, i read everyone's logs
<Kitanai> log: deer , aka HellieCharty comes into the room sweating
<undefined> log: i've been back for 15 minutes and no-one noticed until now. i'm very sneaky
<Kitanai> log: i noticed
<Kimmi> log: I really wanna hang out with Trevor and Izzy, but I'm too busy with my new space friends...
<Kitanai> log: deer looks right at me and prepares to speak
<Nugflow> enim si ytoob ruoy ,reed :gol
<Kitanai> log: all he said was "hey"
<Kitanai> log: his sweat says enough
<Kimmi_Kitty> log: i walk to the bathroom and go on my communicator.
<Kitanai> log: popcorn is better than grits. also we're now having a fight on who's going to win Deer 's butt.
<Professor_Oak> log: log updated noted and logged
